<h1>About the Project</h1>

<blockquote>
    The level by which genes are transcribed is determined in large part by the DNA sequence upstream to the gene, known as the promoter region. Although widely studied, we are still far from a quantitative and predictive understanding of how transcriptional regulation is encoded in gene promoters. One obstacle in the field is obtaining accurate measurements of transcription derived by different promoters. To address this, an experimental system was designed to measure the transcription derived by different promoters, all of which are inserted into the same genomic location upstream to a reporter gene â€“ a yellow florescence protein gene (YFP). The challenge consists of the prediction of the promoter activity given a promoter sequence and a specific experimental condition. To study a set of promoters that share many elements of the regulatory program, and thus are suitable for computational learning, the data pertains to promoters of most of the ribosomal protein genes (RP) of yeast (S.cerevisiae), in rich medium condition (SCD).<br>
